Raw Twitch logs, intermediate availability-aware datasets, and loader utilities live here.
- `raw/`: immutable copies or symlinks to upstream datasets.
- `processing/`: scripts/modules for preprocessing, sampling, and statistics.
- `loader.py`: canonical dataset accessors consumed by training scripts.
